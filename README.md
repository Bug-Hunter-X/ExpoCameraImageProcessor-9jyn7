# Expo Camera Image Corruption Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API with custom image processing.  The issue is characterized by intermittent image corruption resulting in visual artifacts or application crashes. The corruption is not consistent and is difficult to reproduce reliably.

## Bug Description

Images captured using the Expo Camera API and subsequently processed using custom JavaScript functions sometimes exhibit corruption.  This corruption manifests as visual artifacts (e.g., random pixelation, color distortion) or, in more severe cases, causes the application to crash.

## Reproduction Steps

While the bug is difficult to consistently reproduce, it's more likely to occur under certain conditions (high image resolution, intensive image processing). See `bug.js` for an example setup.

## Solution

The solution involves careful error handling and using image manipulation libraries better suited for handling large or potentially corrupted image data. The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates improvements. 

## Note

The exact cause of the intermittent image corruption remains unclear.  It might be related to memory management or limitations in the underlying image processing libraries used by Expo Camera.
